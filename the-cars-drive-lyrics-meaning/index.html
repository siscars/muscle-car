<p>Having used this website for a while, this song finally convinced me to get an account to express my comments. Skip haynes himself recounts we started recording the song on december 31, 1971 and finished it on new years day 1972. Who�s gonna tell you when, it�s too late, who�s gonna tell you things, aren�t so great. It’s sung to someone who thinks that they don’t need other people in their life. The cars anthology (1995) on the compilation knuffelrock (1990)</p>
