<p><strong>Hydrogen Vs Electric Cars 2020</strong>, And while neither produce the harmful carbon emissions of a petrol or diesel engine, they are different. Like electric cars, hydrogen powered fuel cell electric vehicles (fcevs) are are classed as ultra low emission vehicles (ulevs) since the only substance to come out of the exhaust is water vapour. Hydrogen vehicles solve so many of the problems associated with battery electric cars, and yet they have all but disappeared from the discussion on the future of the automobile.</p>

<p>For the time being, hydrogen cars still have a longer range than purely electric cars. And while neither produce the harmful carbon emissions of a petrol or diesel engine, they are different. Nonetheless, it’s hard to accurately tell the driving range of these cars. An alternative is the hydrogen vehicle, or fuel cell electric vehicle (fcev).

<p>Both electric and hydrogen cars lack internal combustion engines and run on electricity instead of petrol or diesel. And while neither produce the harmful carbon emissions of a petrol or diesel engine, they are different.
