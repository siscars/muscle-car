<p>The hydrogen production costs from electrolysis are influenced by the capital costs of the electrolyzer, its utilization and the (average) electricity purchase price during the time of operation. Coregas is currently supplying gas to hydrogen cars being trialled around australia and has built a hydrogen vehicle refuelling plant in northern sydney. Researchers are still tweaking the technology to produce and transport hydrogen fuel. At $3.50 per gallon of gas, a regular vehicle would cost $0.13 per mile but a hydrogen car using $8.00 per kg of fuel would cost $0.12 per mile. Hydrogen is sold in kilograms rather than volume (litres or gallons), and current prices are around £10 to £15 per kg.
