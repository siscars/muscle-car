<h3 id="hydrogen-vehicles-solve-so-many-of-the-problems-associated-with-battery-electric-cars-and-yet-they-have-all-but-disappeared-from-the-discussion-on-the-future-of-the-automobile">Hydrogen vehicles solve so many of the problems associated with battery electric cars, and yet they have all but disappeared from the discussion on the future of the automobile.</h3><p>A hydrogen car will work out as no more expensive to run than a more conventional car. Not only is a hydrogen car exempt from the london congestion charge, its low emissions mean it incurs company car tax at the lowest rate. The hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle (fcev), which simply runs on pressurised hydrogen from a fuelling station, produces zero carbon emissions from its exhaust. Working out relative running costs depends on what you are paying for fuel. In uk, 1kg of hydrogen costs £14.40.</p>
